# java-api-reference

<!-- TODO: Set up GH Actions + badges for the build. Plus Maven Central version info once it gets deployed there. -->

Scans Java jars/classes and produces an API reference source.

This source is not intended to be compilable; rather the intent is for
it to be kept under source control, so that any changes to public API
are easy to detect and track.

## Release Notes

These are available [on GitHub][GHReleases].
